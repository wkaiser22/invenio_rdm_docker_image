  <h2 style="background-color: gray; color: darkred;">Obligations and Rights of the Repository Operator</h2>
    <h3>Inappropriate Data and Legal Infringements</h3>
    <p>The operator reserves the right to reject data and other materials if there are doubts about the 
    legal admissibility of archiving and/or publication. 
    If the Operator becomes aware of any unlawful use or violation of the law after publication, the Operator 
    reserves the right to independently block or remove the data in question from the repository.</p>

    <h3>Publication of Data</h3>
    <p>All accepted datasets will be published through the repository and will be assigned a persistent 
    identifier (DOI), making the data uniquely referenced and citable.</p>

    <h3>Data Curation</h3>
    <p>The uploaded data will not be scientifically reviewed by the repository operator itself. 
      However, the operator will implement a peer-review based data curation methodology where data 
      curators associated with the project will undertake this task. <p>

    <h3>Retention Period</h3>
    <p>The minimum guaranteed retention period for research data is 10 years, in line with the 
      German Research Foundation's <a href="https://www.dfg.de/download/pdf/foerderung/rechtliche_rahmenbedingungen/gute_wissenschaftliche_praxis/kodex_gwp.pdf">
      (DFG) recommendations </a> for ensuring good scientific practice.</p>

    <h3>Continuous Development</h3>
    <p>The operator is constantly developing FDM@DHBW and reserves the right to adapt the service both technically 
    and organisationally and to discontinue the service at any time or to replace it with another service. 
    If FDM@DHBW is discontinued, data, metadata and other materials will be retained for the remaining agreed period.</p>

    <h3>Bitstream Preservation</h3>
    <p> The operator will not alter the content of data uploaded to the Repository. 
    There will be no migration to new file formats, instead the so-called bitstream preservation method will be applied. 
    However, the permanent usability and interpretability of the data cannot be guaranteed, as it depends on the 
    availability of the necessary software to read the data. 
    The repository operator reserves the right to convert the data into other file formats, in which case the 
    original data will be preserved.</p>

    <h3>Data Backup</h3>
    <p>Data and metadata in FDM@DHBW are stored on long-term storage hardware provided by the DHBW Computing Service Center (TBD). 
    All data will be backed up and multiple copies will be kept in separate locations (geo-redundancy). 
    The operator reserves the right to move data to other servers under its control.</p>

  <h2 style="background-color: gray; color: darkred;">Obligations and Rights of the Data Provider</h2>
  <h3>Export Controls in Science and Research</h3>
    <p>All researchers and data contributors must inform themselves about and take full responsibility for 
    compliance with 
    <a href="https://www.bafa.de/DE/Aussenwirtschaft/Ausfuhrkontrolle/Academia/academia_node.html">
    export control regulations</a> when depositing data in this repository. 
    Export control laws apply to the sharing, transfer, and publication of research data, materials, software, 
    and technical knowledge. 
    These regulations affect numerous university activities including international research collaborations, 
    knowledge and data transfers, publications, and cooperation with international researchers.</p>

    <h3>Rights of Use</h3>
      <p>Data provider are responsible for determining the completeness and integrity of their data.</p>
      <p>AThe data provider assures that he holds the rights to use the data and grants the repository operator a 
      non-exclusive right to use the transferred digital data sets and documents for an unlimited period of time 
      immediately upon transfer, in particular
      <ul>
        <li>The right to systematically archive the data and to use them for the purposes of long-term digital 
          preservation and publication,</li>
        <li>The right to migrate the data to successor technical systems,</li>
        <li>The right to make published data permanently available to the public for online viewing and 
          downloading as part of the online services of the FDM@DHBW repository, taking into account the established 
          embargo periods and the selected licence for data re-use.</li>  
      </ul>
      The data provider also agrees that the descriptions (metadata) of the research data may be published under 
      a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons CC0 licence </a> and shared 
      with other metadata harvesting repositories. 
      </p>
      <p> The data provider's copyrights will be retained, allowing the data to be transferred to other institutions 
      for archiving or publication.</p>
      <p> By submitting data to FDM@DHBW, the data provider warrants that the data and ancillary materials to be made 
      available without special access authorisation are not in breach of any law, are free from third party 
      rights and comply with relevant data protection legislation.
      In particular, personal data containing information on an individual level must be anonymised in such a way 
      that individual identification is excluded (falsification). 
      The data provider indemnifies the operator from all claims of third parties, including all costs of legal defence 
      and prosecution.</p>

    <h3>Withdrawal of Data</h3>
      <p>It is not the intention of the data provider to withdraw data that has already been published. 
      In justified exceptional cases (e.g. faulty files, legal issues) data may be withdrawn after consultation with 
      the operator. However, some minimal metadata may remain publicly available and the DOI assigned to the data may 
      continue to be resolved to the FDM@DHBW repository with a reference to the withdrawal of the data.

<section>
  <h2 style="background-color: gray; color: darkred;">Accessibility and Restrictions</h2>
    <h3>Open Data Intention</h3>
    <p> As a publisher of research data and in alignment with the DHBW Open Science principle 
      - "as open as possible, as closed as required" -  research data should be made openly accessible to the 
      greatest extent possible. 
      Where necessary, access restrictions or embargo periods may be applied to protect sensitive data, 
      intellectual property, or the legitimate interests of DHBW’s partner institutions and stakeholders.
      In all cases, the metadata describing the research data should, whereever possible, be directly accessible 
      and searchable via the internet. 
      This helps ensure that research and innovation outputs remain discoverable and interoperable, 
      even when access to the underlying data is restricted. </p>

      in particular if obligations under this contract have not been met despite a reminder. 
      Termination must be in writing and must state the reasons for termination. 
      The deletion of data and metadata from the repository will be carried out in a timely manner, 
      depending on the operator's resources and the volume of data. 
      Upon request, the data provider may export the data and metadata for its own purposes prior to deletion. 
      If a Creative Commons licence has been chosen, the rights of use for the benefit of the general public 
      will continue after the end of the contract.</p>
